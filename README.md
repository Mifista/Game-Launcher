# Game-Launcher
This is my personal project of a Game launcher, which helps me to navigate among my programs and to practice C#. It is currently work in progress and lacks some critical funcionality, A.E. - adding new programs and adding them to favorites.

Current funcionality:
  Login/Password system (changes should be made in a "password.txt" file)
  Launching applications from the program
  Changing path to the executable file of the application
 
Incoming changes:
    Ability to add of new users via form in program
    Ability to add new programs
    Favorite list
    
  Default Login and Password are: JohnLasley Antony121.
